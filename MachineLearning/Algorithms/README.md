## Fun Coding Ideas

### Graph Search Algorithm Visuallizer
This project would create graphs and then be able to implement different search algorithms. These would be put on a website page and the parameters of the search algorithms would be dynamic so the user can change them to see how it alters the algorithm. Metrics would be created for each algorithm to evaluate the algorithm.

#### Visuallizers
1. Binary Tree Graph
2. N-ary Tree Graph
3. N-node Graph

I would start with the simplest visuallizer (Binary Tree) and once I have that working and formatted I would create an N-ary Tree and finally a N-node graph. Following good OOP practices the N-node graph would be the high level class and N-ary Tree would inherit from N-node Graph. The same goes for Binary Tree and N-aray Tree.

#### Search Algorithms
- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search
- A* Search
- Alpha/Beta Pruning Augmentation
- ???

These search algorithms would contain the information to run on the graph object. They would also have the metrics necessary for the webpage and perhaps some sort of UI object to initialize the UI.

#### Reasons
This would be a great way to practice my javascript, work on static webpage implementations with CSS and HTML, and a good way for me to review the search algorithms.
